# EpyTodo

EpyTodo is the projet that introduced me in Web Development during my first year at Epitech.  
The goal was to create a functional Todo List application using Node.js and Express.  
The project focuses on the backend development, providing users with the ability to manage their tasks easily.  
In addition to the backend, any frontend was considered as a bonus.
